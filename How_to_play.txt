How to play? 
Open main.py and compile the project. 
Next, follow the questions in the console and choose your mode of play (as a default it is player versus AI).
Empty hexes with black borders indicate possible moves. 
To activate AI's turn you also must click on one of them and then he will choose his move.
The second window allows to choose mode of the game. Either player vs player or a game versus AI.

#Config file allows to change some parameters of the game. Like a depth search or size of the window.
